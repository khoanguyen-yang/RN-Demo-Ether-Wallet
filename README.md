# RN Demo Application

## Installation & Development

1. Setup React Native environment for both iOS and Android (https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup - React Native CLI Quickstart)

   1.1. For iOS environment, Ruby `2.7.5` is required. You probably need a Ruby version manager such as [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [RVM](https://rvm.io/) for easier installation.

2. `yarn && cd ios && pod install && cd ..`

3. `npx react-native start`

4. `npx react-native run-ios` or `npx react-native run-android` (in another terminal window)
